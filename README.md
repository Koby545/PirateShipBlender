# 🏴‍☠️ Pirate Ship 3D Model – First Project

This is my **first complete 3D pirate ship project**, built using **Blender**.  
It includes exterior details, decks, lower deck, anchor, stairs, railings, ropes, and props like barrels and cannonballs.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is my first 3D modeling project. Some parts may not be perfectly accurate or optimized, but it was a great learning experience!

## 🛠 Features

- **🚢 Exterior** – Hull, mast, and ropes for realism
- **🪜 Deck & Stairs** – Upper deck with railing, stairs leading to lower deck
- **💎 Lower Deck** – Treasure area with supporting columns
- **⚓ Anchor** – Basic anchor at the front
- **🪵 Props** – Barrels, crates, cannonballs, ropes
- **🎨 First-Time Modeling** – Used some free Blender kits as reference and for practice
